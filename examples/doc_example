# Example for documentation

# Define initial temperature of our system:
define T0 20mK

# Describe copper block with mass 100g
# in a contact with 1 mole of liquid He3 at 0 bar:
block  Cu ${T0} type=paramagnet material=copper mass=100g
block  He ${T0} type=liquid_he3 volume=36cm^3 P=0bar

# They are linked by Kapitza thernal resistance which
# is proportional to contact surface area. Let's use
# area 1m^2 (it's not that big for sintered-powder heat exchangers)
link   k1 Cu He type=kap_res_he3 area=1m^2

# We will cool the system by mixing chamber (MC) of a simple dilution
# fridge with cooling power proportional to T^2, circulation 50 umol/s
# and external heat leak 0.2uW.

block  MC ${T0} type=simple C=0.2J/K # use some reasonable heat capacity
block  bath 300K type=bath   # this is needed as a sink for heat leaks
link MC_cooling MC bath type=dilution_cooling ndot=50umol/s
link MC_heatleak bath MC type=const Qdot=0.2uW

# The copper block is connected to the mixing chamber with a heat switch
# with electrical resistance 10 uOhm:
link precool MC Cu type=metal_bar R=10uOhm

# Magnetic field is 8T
field 8T

# We will be calculating with some large steps (30min). To keep the accuracy
# intermediate steps will be always done by the program. We can show/hide them
# by setting print_substeps to 1/0
print_substeps 0

# Now define what do we want to print: time, magnetic field,
# temperatures of a few blocks and heat flow through a link
print t B T(MC) T(Cu) T(He) Q(precool)

# Where we print result (use '-' for stdout):
print_to_file doc_example.dat

# Precool for 72h.
run 72h 30m

####
# Now we precooled to about 9mK. Let's disconnect HS and
# demagnetize to 0.4T (20 times) during 10h:

link precool MC Cu type=metal_bar R=1MOhm
field_rate -0.76T/h
run 10h 30m

# And now just wait
field_rate 0T/h
run 18h 30m
